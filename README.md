**Kye concepts**
**List** :is a basic data structure in Python that stores multiple items.
**Random**: Using the random module to make choices with numbers that pop up out of nowhere.
**Data Aggregation**: The process of combining data from various pieces and sources into a single summary.
**Sorting**: Arranging data in a specified order, in this case, descending order based on sales figures.
**Code Structure**
**The code is structured into six main steps:**
Create a list of unique city names
Produce a list of cities that may have duplicates
Give each city random sales data
Combine all the sales data together
Sort the combined sales data
Output the final results
Sort the combined sales data
Output the final results

**Step-by-Step Explanation**
	Creating a List of Unique Cities:
	A list named cities_list is initialized with 15 unique city names. This serves as the source for generating sales data.
	Generating a List of Cities with Duplicates:
	A list comprehension is used to create a new list called cities, which contains 45 entries. Each entry is randomly selected from cities_list, allowing for duplicates.
	Assigning Random Sales Data:
	Another list comprehension generates sales_data, where each city in the cities list is paired with a random sales figure between 1000 and 5000. This simulates sales data for each city.
	Aggregating Sales Data:
	An empty list aggregated_sales is initialized. The code iterates through sales_data, checking if the city already exists in aggregated_sales. If it does, the sales figure is added to the existing entry. If not, a new entry is created.
	Sorting the Aggregated Sales Data:
	The sorted() function is employed to sort aggregated_sales in descending order based on the sales figures. The sorting is achieved using a lambda function as the key.
	Outputting the Results:
	Finally, the sorted sales data is printed to the console, displaying each city alongside its total sales.
